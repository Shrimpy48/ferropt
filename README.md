# ferropt

A layout optimiser for the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) and similar keyboards, using [simulated annealing](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?simulated_annealing).
Inspired by projects like [carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?), with the goal of optimising complex, multi-layer keyboard layouts.

This is primarily designed for personal use: the heuristics are intended to model my typing and the code is not always to the highest standard, but it may nevertheless be a useful starting point for other projects.
